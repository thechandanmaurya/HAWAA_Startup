    <p>If we consider the IT scenario to remain the same in next years following could happen:

        You will be thrilled to start your career at an IT firm at a salary (range mentioned is just in general, not like IITs some of who earn more than small-time CEOs ) in the range of 3-5 Lakhs per annum (LPA). The company will provide you training and will induct you in one of their projects - support, development, Infra etc.
        You will make new friends, experience new technologies, will see corporate life from its closest including politics, favoritism, of course rewards & recognition, your manager's pampering and tampering. First 2 years will be gone by the wind.
        Next you will either look for onsite opportunities or start looking for a new job with higher pay package (if you are not of the kind who would be going for higher studies then ballgame is different). If you are lucky you will get onsite and you & your family be happiest that would be going abroad for more bucks and knowledge.
        You will come back (unless you want to remain there by hook or crook) and start looking for a new job (yes!). So you will get a job say in the range of 6-8 LPA and 3-4 years have already passed
        Parents will start forcing you to get married, you will be focused on your career and next promotion. Next 2-3 years you be in a Lead position managing a small team with a package of 10-12 LPA at your 2nd or 3rd organization.
        7 years have passed approximately and if you have saved enough money from your onsite trip and monthly income, you will be able to book a flat somewhere remote area in a metro city. You will be probably married and would be enjoying a good time.
        Another change, a project manager like position with a salary of 15-18 LPA in a big IT company and a "kindda" smooth life. 10 years have passed!
        Its good to worry about the future but let it be, you are too young to worry so much. Let the future unfolds itself and you will be surprised what it will present to you. Enjoy the present as Oogway said - Past is history, future is mystery, today is a gift thats why we call it "present"</p>
