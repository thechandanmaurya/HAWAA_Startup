        <h3> About Fresher Jobs</h3>
        <p>In India and all over world, term fresher stands for “raw students.”Raw Student- Student with no experience of real world.In India scenario is lil different from many countries, because students focus more on degrees rather than focusing on practical world. They’ve no clue about the industry they want to get into. As they believe that good marks will help them landing at good platform.Mostly its true, but than low grade students have to deal with a tag of “fresher”.
            But what industry people demand is someone with the basic knowledge of industry.So, To overcome the tag of fresher- I would like to suggest freshers to pick up an internship before picking up a job.</p>
