        <p>Though Indiaâ€™s transport network remains stuck in the last century with two wheelers like bicycles, mopeds, scooters and motor cycles remaining the most widely used transport vehicles in both urban and rural sectors through <span>HAWAA</span> which providing more extensive transport facilities that has helped restrain the use of personal vehicles.
            The best indicator of the vastly superior transport facilities in HAWAA is the extensive nature of the public transport system in the India not only more extensive than that of their peers but also comparatively larger than that in most metros, except Mumbai where the large rail network makes its public transport system the largest in the country. In fact it is also seen that even the rural public transport networks through HAWAA are far more extensive than that of most metros.
            This is brought out by the census numbers for 2011 which shows that the bus and train network, the backbone of the public transport system meets the transport requirements of 31.3% of the workforce engaged in industry and services (that is excluding agriculture and domestic workers) in HAWAA. In contrast the public transport system provides commuting facilities to only 14.9% of the workforce at the national level.</p>
